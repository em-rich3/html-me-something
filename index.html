				<p>Lyndee was the first family pet that I grew up with starting in 1996.
				   While I don't remember much of her from my childhood, I do recall that she looked exactly like Lassie from the movies. 
				   Lyndee was my introduction to the powerful bond between people and pets that paved the way for so many more companions to come!

				<p>Bo was a Bull Mastiff/German Shepherd that my mom received from a coworker.
					He part of my life until second grade when he passed away from stomach cancer. 
					Bo could pick up his bowl and bring it to the dish washer. 
					He looked out for my sisters and me with a protective, watchful eye. 
					We loved pretending to play-wrestle with him and would shout "Jump on me dog!" to stir up some fun.

				<div class="paragraph-text">
				<p>After Bo passed away, it wasn't long until my sisters and I were hounding my parents (pun intended) to get another dog.
					We browsed the website PetFinder at the time to find rescue dogs in our area. The final two choices were between Taco, an Australian Shepherd/Border Collie mix, or Winston, a Beagle mix. 
					I was so determined to get my family to choose Taco that I had my classmates vote on the two dogs at lunch and brought the winning results home to my parents for proof that Taco was the best choice. 
					My family rescued Taco from Clover Leaf Animal Hospital in 2003 and he stayed with us for 12 unforgettable years until the summer after I graduated college.
					Taco was gentle and kind, a true sweetheart by nature. 
					He was a fan favorite with friends, neighbors, and passersby anywhere we went. 
					He roadtripped with us across the U.S. and even visited our college campuses.
					Needless to say, he was the most popular pup around wherever he went.

				<p>Taco left big paws to fill, but Copper came into the picture and has taken my family on a wild ride since summer 2018!
					Copper was rescued from a small town outside of Birmingham, Alabama and is a Blonde Border Collie.
					Over the past two years, he has had so much energy that my family almost hasn't know what to do with it all!
					Copper is rambunctous, playful, and a literal jumping bean! 
					He has since learned to jump through a hula-hoop to channel his wild side.

				<div class="paragraph-text">
				<p>I first met Autumn when I was volunteering at the Humane Society of Missouri on the Kennel Enrichment team during the fall of 2019. 
					Every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, I would work with a team of three to five women to provide one-on-one attention and care for the dogs in both wings of the shelter. 
					On a given day, I would interact with 20-40 dogs. 
					Over the course of five weeks, I kept returning to see Autumn still in Wing 2 at the shelter. 
					She was recovering from parvo and a subsequent upper respiratory infection that had turned into pneumonia.
					Even through all that, her energy was infectious and when she rolled over for a belly rub, my heart melted.
					On the day she went up for adoption, I whisked her away, and we've been having a blast ever since!
					Autumn loves to run, enjoys endless belly rubs, and is a pro at getting into occassional mischief. 
					She's my first companion that I can truly call my own, and I'm excited for a lifetime of adventures yet to come!
